# 🐝 BuzzyBee

**BuzzyBee** is a handheld focusing and relaxation device designed to help users regulate breathing and reduce anxiety through guided visual cues and vibration feedback. The device is portable, rechargeable, and intentionally simple, making it accessible and easy to use in everyday settings.

## 🎯 Purpose

BuzzyBee was created to support focus and calmness by guiding users through structured breathing exercises. By combining light patterns and haptic feedback, the device provides a non-intrusive way to pause, reset, and refocus—especially during moments of stress or overstimulation.

## ✨ Features

- Guided breathing using expanding and contracting light patterns  
- Vibration feedback to reinforce breathing rhythm  
- Portable, handheld design  
- Rechargeable battery  
- Custom 3D-printed enclosure  
- Low-cost build (under \$50)

## 🛠️ Hardware & Electronics

- Microcontroller: Arduino Nano  
- LEDs for visual breathing guidance  
- Vibration motor for haptic feedback  
- Rechargeable battery and charging circuit  
- Custom-designed electronics and wiring  
- 3D-printed casing for durability and comfort

## 🧠 Inspiration

BuzzyBee was developed as part of a hands-on engineering project focused on wellness and accessibility. The goal was to create a calming tool that does not rely on screens or apps, allowing users to disconnect while still benefiting from guided relaxation techniques.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Adjustable breathing patterns  
- Customizable feedback modes (adjust vibration and light settings)  
- Improved smoothness and aesthetics of light effects through brightness and color fading  
- Enhanced enclosure design to house electronics more securely  
- Custom PCB design to improve the stability and reliability of the electronics
- Create ambient lighting that changes based on the time of day using an RTC clock module
  
## 📌 Status
